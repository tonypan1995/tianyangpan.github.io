I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University. I am affiliated with [Kavraki Lab](https://www.kavrakilab.org/), directed by Dr. Lydia Kavraki.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked with Prof. Odest Chadwicke Jenkins and his [Lab for Progress](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, my major was Information Engineering.

I'm interested in research topics related to robotics, including but not limited to task and motion planning, perception, and robotic learning. My lab mates and I are collaborating together to make robots better help people in daily lives.
